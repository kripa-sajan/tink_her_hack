# CipherCraft

A web tool to check the strength of user-entered passwords in real-time. This project includes a JavaScript-based password strength algorithm, along with a simple and intuitive user interface implemented using HTML and CSS.

## Features

- Real-time password strength feedback as users type.
- Color-coded indicators to visually represent the strength of the password.
- Password strength requirements displayed for user guidance.
- Option to toggle password visibility using an eye icon.
- Save button activation based on password strength.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Getting Started

To use CipherCraft, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How It Works

The Password Strength Checker evaluates the strength of a password based on the following criteria:

1. Minimum length of 8 characters.
2. Presence of at least one number (0-9).
3. Presence of at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
4. Presence of at least one special symbol (!@#$%^&*()-_=+).
5. Presence of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).

The strength of the password is calculated and displayed in real-time, along with color-coded indicators to signify its strength level. Users can also toggle the visibility of the password using the eye icon. The "Save" button is activated only when the password meets the minimum strength criteria.
